# Milestones
> This file lays out a general timeline that you can follow to gauge your progress on P1. 

> We can break our project down into smaller MVPs in order to make it more manageable. 

## By the beginning of Week 5
- Requirement Traceability Matrix and Test Case Document created
  - (Requirements and Test Cases with preconditions, steps, expected results, etc.)
- Database is set up (make sure you can view your Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) and that it reflects the foreign key relationships between your tables)
- Application is connected to AWS RDS Database
  - (You are able to create a Connection Object using the ConnectionUtil class and DB credentials stored either in a `connection.properties` file or as System Environment Variables)
- Database persistence started (begin DAO implementation) - if this is complete then you're in good shape

## By the middle of Week 5
